## Website Information

Terms:

- Pathway: ie Computer Science


- Tracks: ie Software Development, frontend/backend web dev
- Courses: ie Intro to Software Dev, HTML, CSS.
  - Courses are what teach the subjects.
- Course Choices: ie SCSS, Vite, Bootstrap
  - Let's say you are learning front-end development. After learning HTML, and CSS you need to learn a CSS framework. That's when you take either the SCSS, Bootstrap course, or both. Then you learn Javascript; after that, you can learn either React, Vue, Angular, or as many as you want

Practice Types:

- Coding practice: write code, submit, and it checks the code to be correct
- Strict Practice: For example if it asks you "What's 1 + 1" you would type 2.
- Multichoice Questions: If you're doing a test, you can choose multi-choice answers
- Peer Review answers: If Jack and Jill are working on the question: "What's 1 + 1" When they both submit an answer Jill will grade Jack's work, and Jack will grade Jill's work giving feedback. If Jack is lonely, and has no partner he can skip the question.

Media Types:

- Videos (You can watch these)
- Audio (They should be able to read it like an audiobook. Just hit play and it narrates the lesson)
- Text (with MD). Using Markdown, you can incorporate text, videos, pictures, and audio. Audio should be available for text lessons.
